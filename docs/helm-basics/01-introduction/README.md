# Introduction to Helm

## What is Helm?

Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes**, similar to how `apt` works for Ubuntu or `yum` for CentOS.

* It helps you define, install, and manage applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.
* Instead of writing multiple YAML files for Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc., Helm packages them into a **single reusable unit** called a **Helm Chart**.

Think of Helm as the “apt-get” or “npm” for Kubernetes.

**Official Documenation** : https://helm.sh/docs/

## What is Helm used for?

1. **Simplifies Deployment**

   * One command (`helm install`) can deploy a full application stack.
   * Example: WordPress with its database, services, ingress, and persistent volumes.

2. **Configuration Management**

   * Values can be overridden at install/upgrade time (`values.yaml` or `--set`).
   * Makes it easy to deploy the same app to **dev, test, staging, prod** with different settings.

3. **Versioning & Rollbacks**

   * Every deployment is tracked as a **release** with a **revision number**.
   * You can upgrade (`helm upgrade`) or roll back (`helm rollback`) easily.

4. **Sharing Applications**

   * Helm charts can be packaged and stored in **Helm Repositories** (public or private).
   * Teams can reuse and share charts.

5. **Lifecycle Management**

   * Install, upgrade, rollback, or uninstall applications cleanly.
   * Helps enforce best practices in Kubernetes deployments.

## Alternatives to Helm

While Helm is the most popular, there are other tools for managing Kubernetes applications:

1. **Kustomize**

   * Built into `kubectl` (`kubectl apply -k`).
   * Works by patching and overlaying YAMLs rather than using templating.
   * No separate templating engine, purely Kubernetes-native.

2. **Jsonnet / Tanka**

   * Uses Jsonnet (a JSON-based templating language) for Kubernetes manifests.
   * Gives strong programming constructs but has a learning curve.

3. **Kpt (by Google)**

   * Works with YAML configurations stored in Git.
   * Focuses on GitOps-style workflows with validation and packaging.

4. **Ansible + Kubernetes Modules**

   * Some teams prefer using Ansible playbooks to manage Kubernetes objects.

5. **Pulumi / Terraform (with Kubernetes provider)**

   * Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools that can also deploy and manage Kubernetes workloads.
   * Used when you want Kubernetes deployments integrated with broader infrastructure provisioning.

✅ **Summary:**

* **Helm = Kubernetes package manager**.
* Makes app deployment repeatable, shareable, and manageable.
* Alternatives exist (Kustomize, Jsonnet, Kpt, Ansible, Pulumi, Terraform), but Helm remains the **most widely adopted and community-supported solution**.
